# Portfolio

Week 2 Assignment

Objectives

Make the standard portfolio site you coded last week responsive
Create a unique and sophisticated portfolio using Bootstrap
Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

Week 2 Mantra

Week 1 you learned a lot of html/css, github and heroku Week 2 you'll learn an easier way to manage the html/css along with some more github stuff Week 3 we'll start JavaScript, and weeks 1+2 get used a lot less

There is no need to panic over week 1's material. Because you'll have 23 weeks to digest it and get good at it.

Again, Week 1 doesn't build over the next 23 weeks. Stay calm. You'll have plenty of time to get better at it.

Instructions

Create a new repository, name it Portfolio
Add the README.md to this repository
git clone this repository onto your machine
cd into your local copy of the repository
Create the folders assignment1 and assignment2
Copy the contents (index.html, portfolio.html, assets, composer.json, etc) of Basic-Portfolio aka the first HW and paste the mentioned files into assignment1
Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g .git, .gitignore for example) from the Basic-Portfolio repo.
Assignment One Instructions

Inside your assignment1 folder, find your style.css file, it may be in assets/css. At the bottom of styles.css you will write your media queries.
Use three @media screen tags with a max-width of 980px, 768px, and 640px.
You use 980px because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before it cuts off the content. 768px is about the width of a tablet and 640px is about the width of a phone in landscape
Make the layout match the following screenshots:
index.html - 980px, 768px, 640px
portfolio.html - 980px, 768px, 640px
contact.html - 980px, 768px, 640px
Make the position of the header static (the default positioning) when the screen is 640px wide. You want to do this because the header design takes up a lot of room which is undesirable on small screens.
Be sure to include the viewport tag in all your html files.
Pro-tip: Use the Chrome extensions Window Resizer and Browser Width to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.
